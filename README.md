# Check-similarity-tools
Project Description:

The capstone project involves developing a tool that can analyze code snippets and determine their level of similarity for assignments submitted by students. The tool should be able to work with various programming languages and should provide an output that indicates the level of similarity between the code snippets. The output should include suggestions to improve the code snippets, and the tool should be developed using OOP principles in Python.

Assessment Criteria:

1. Encapsulation: The student should demonstrate their understanding of encapsulation by defining classes with appropriate access modifiers for methods and attributes. The student should also demonstrate their ability to create objects and use instance variables.
2. Inheritance: The student should demonstrate their understanding of inheritance by creating classes that inherit from other classes and make use of inherited methods and attributes. The student should also demonstrate their ability to override methods in the subclass.
3. Polymorphism: The student should demonstrate their understanding of polymorphism by implementing methods that can accept parameters of different types or behave differently depending on the context in which they are called. The student should also demonstrate their ability to use method overloading and method overriding.
4. Abstraction: The student should demonstrate their ability to use abstraction to simplify complex code by defining interfaces or abstract classes. The student should also demonstrate their understanding of how to implement abstraction in Python using abstract base classes.
5. Design Patterns: The student should demonstrate their ability to apply OOP design patterns such as Factory, Singleton, and Observer in their code to solve specific problems. The student should also demonstrate their understanding of how to implement these patterns in Python.

Suggested Classes and Objects for Assessment:

Class: CodeSnippet Attributes: code (string), language (string) Methods: get_code(), set_code(), get_language(), set_language()
Class: CodeSimilarityChecker Attributes: threshold (float), snippets (list of CodeSnippet objects) Methods: add_snippet(), remove_snippet(), check_similarity(), suggest_improvements()
Class: ProgrammingLanguage Attributes: name (string), file_extension (string) Methods: get_name(), set_name(), get_file_extension(), set_file_extension()
Object: InheritanceExample This object would include a code snippet that demonstrates inheritance in Python, along with a brief explanation of the concept and how it is used in the code.
Object: PolymorphismExample This object would include
